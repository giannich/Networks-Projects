# Networks-Projects

Main three projects for my Winter 2017 Networks class:

- Project 1 is an echo client-server that uses sockets to communicate.
- Project 2 is an HTTP Server that responds to HTTP Requests using a TCP connection.
- Project 3 is a Ping Client that pings a server and calculates the RTT using a UDP connection.
