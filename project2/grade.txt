Grading:
    Compiles, starts, binds to a TCP port: 10 / 10
    GET requests return 200 + the data for all existing files in tree: 7 / 10
    GET requests return 404 for all non-existent paths: 10 / 10
    HEAD requests return 200 (but no data) for all existing files: 10 / 10
    HEAD requests return 301, 404 for all paths in exactly the same way as for GET 10 / 10
    Any POST request or other unknown method returns a 403: 10 / 10
    Any invalid request returns a 403, or a 5xx error code of your choosing: 7 / 10
    Server can handle multiple requests in succession without restarting: 10 / 10
    Style points, grader discretion: 9 / 10

Penalties:
    Performs no validation of request besides checking request type: -3
    Errors in properly displaying png image: -3
    Lots of dead code left commented out: -1


Comments:
    Good job overall. The only problems are that you didn't properly validate requests,
    and that you did not properly display image files. Beyond that, we prefer that
    you remove dead code rather than leaving it in commented.

Grade:
    91 / 100
